### Selected Projects

- **Circadian scRNA-seq (AL vs CR):** Identified rhythm-associated cell populations using single-cell analysis of circadian clock genes.  
- **Proteogenomics ML Model:** Developed a machine learning framework to predict protein abundance from RNA-seq data.  
- **Nextflow Multi-omics Pipeline:** Fully automated pipelines for transcriptomics and metagenomics, deployed on HPC.  
- **Ligament Regeneration Multi-omics:** Integrated exosomal RNA, bulk RNA-seq, and pathway analysis to identify healing regulators.  
- **Seq2Pheno AI/ML Pipeline:** Snakemake workflow, TensorFlow models, tissue phenotype imputation.  
- **MacVis Tool:** Lightweight macrophage phenotype visualization tool with GO/KEGG/Circos integration.
